The City Council for the City of Chicago is urged to ensure the majority of HIV/AIDS funding is provided to high impact communities identified by the AIDS Foundation Chicago, to address these health disparities."

Despite African Americans accounting for over half of new HIV diagnoses, only 4.46% of the $40.4 million HIV/AIDS budget was allocated to African American/Black-led community-based organizations. Dr. Ige's plan to provide $2 million annually to HIV/AIDS-related service organizations led by Black same-gender-loving men is a step towards addressing these disparities."
