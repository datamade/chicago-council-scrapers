The strategy, outlined in Exhibit A, involves issuing $1.7 billion in pension obligation bonds, re-amortizing unfunded liability, frontloading additional contributions, and shifting annual contributions to the fiscal year's start. This aims to achieve a 90% funded ratio, retire 4.7% of unfunded liabilities, and save an estimated $10.5 billion, with $2.3B in savings from shifting contributions alone, via the Chicago Pension Ramp."
