It supports immigrants, opposes undermining the Welcoming City Ordinance, defends constitutional rights, federalism principles, sanctuary protections, and the right to peaceful assembly. The resolution also acknowledges community-based anti-violence organizations, Mayor Brandon Johnson's authority, and promotes community policing, education, and jobs."

The ordinance is effective 90 days post-passage."
