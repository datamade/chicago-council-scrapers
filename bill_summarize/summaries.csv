The ordinance, effective immediately, states no one over 38 can be a firefighter/EMT, and no one over 55 can be a police officer. However, age restrictions don't apply to employment lists in existence at passage or rehiring of former employees, subject to human resources rules. Alderman Gilbert Villegas presented the ordinance."
