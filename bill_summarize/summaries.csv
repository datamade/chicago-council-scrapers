The building, home to a record store from 1978 to 1993, significantly influenced Chicago's music scene and helped launch industrial music in the US. The store, frequented by director John Hughes, offered diverse music genres and served as a hub for various communities, including the LGBTQ+ community. The building's Renaissance Revival cornice, white-glazed brick inspired by the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, and exterior elevations contributed to its landmark status. A plaque will be created to identify the building, and the ordinance took effect upon passage and approval."
