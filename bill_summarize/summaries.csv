These parkways, equivalent to the Chicago Park District, have caused steady 311 flooding- and blocked-sewer- complaints due to turfgrasses, as per Municipal Code of Chicago 10-32-050. The council's Native and Pollinator Garden Advisory Board Registry and the concept of curbside wetlands on parkways aim to provide ecological benefits and long-term cost savings. A subject matter hearing is called, and city agencies like the Department of Transportation, Water Management, Streets and Sanitation, and Environment may conduct a cost-benefit study."
