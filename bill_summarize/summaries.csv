The resolution, spurred by COVID, notes 257,000 uninsured Chicagoans, loss of employer-sponsored insurance, $5,600 average annual healthcare spending, and better outcomes in universal access areas. It calls for an equitable, comprehensive replacement, supported by two thirds of Americans, regardless of employment, marital, or citizenship status."
