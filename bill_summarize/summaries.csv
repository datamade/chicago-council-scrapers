The Department of Planning and Development has created a platform, ChiBlockBuilder, to sell City-owned properties. The Missing Middle Infill Housing Initiative aims to revitalize neighborhoods by offering vacant lots for $1 to developers for residential construction, with potential grants of up to $150,000 per housing unit. The City Council has approved the sale of City Lots to Missing Middle Chicago, LLC, for a project involving multifamily residential buildings. The City also allows temporary leases and waives certain requirements to encourage homeownership. The ordinance will take effect upon approval. The parcels of land are located in various subdivisions within Cook County. The City of Chicago will convey and quitclaim all interest and title in the real property to the company, subject to various conditions and covenants. The transfer is exempt under relevant tax laws."
