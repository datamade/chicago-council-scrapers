Rapid Response Parking Enforcement Aides, managed by the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, the Commissioner of the Department of Finance, the Commissioner of the Office of Emergency Management and Communications, and the Traffic Compliance Officer, will handle parking enforcement, freeing police officers for other duties.
